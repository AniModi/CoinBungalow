# Welcome to Coin Bungalow!

A DAO governed decentralized platform to apply for, list, sell & buy properties as NFTs, borrow & lend money through peer to peer NFT collateralized loans and empower your community through the power of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. 

## Getting Started
Navigate to my profile, in the menu side bar, and mint a profile soul bound token (SBT) for yourself. This soul bound token is a special type of NFT which is non transferrable, represents you and is modified according to your actions (credit score in this case). This functionality goes through our SBT.sol smart contract.

### 1. You want to list your property for sale
You can navigate to sell a property, if you own no NFTs, do not worry, you can apply for a property NFT by listing the respective property with supporting documents, wait for approval and verification by the governace and boom..! a unique property NFT will be minted for you.
Properties can be listed seamlessly by filling an application form through the Add NFT option in menu sidebar.

After submission by you and its approval, verification & execution by the governance, you will be able to see your very own property NFT in the My NFTs section. This property NFT acts as the proof of ownership.
The verification of documents and other crucial details (value, area, etc. of the property) provided in the application form, is necessary to promote a fraud-proof ecosystem. The minting of the property NFTs is handled by our PropertyNFT.sol smart contract.
The property NFTs are dynamic in nature, means their metadata can be updated without any hassle. If you just built a new swimming pool in your property, do not worry, it will be no hassle to update the NFT details. The metadata of the property NFTs are stored on a decentralized database (Polybase), which allows efficient querying and updation of the metadata.

Now what are you waiting for? Click any of your owned NFTs, choose the list for sale option and boom.. your property is listed for sale now! This listing for sale functionality goes through our PropertyDeal.sol escrow, and your property NFT is transferred to this escrow. You can anytime unlist your property if you feel like it is not the right time to sell it. This can be done through the Property Actions section in your profile dashboard. Once you unlist your property, the respective property NFT will be transferred back from the escrow to your account.

If you choose not to unlist the NFT, prospective buyers can see your property NFT and show or revoke interest in it. If a buyer shows interest in your property, he will simply pay you the estimated value of your property and the respective property NFT will be transferred from the escrow to the buyer's account, thus transferring ownership rights. No complex paperwork !

### 2. You are interested in buying a property
Just checkout the property details, see if it suits you, visit the property if you want to, using the Google Maps location mentioned. Pay the requested price and the property ownership rights will be transferred to you! The property NFT will move from the escrow to your account.

### 1. You want to apply for a loan

Loan management is done through our Loans.sol escrow smart contract. To apply for a loan, you have to stake your NFT as collateral and submit your desired loan details (loan term, amount and APR). On collateralization, your NFT is moved from your account to the escrow and potential lenders can see your loan request. Loans can be tracked from your profile dashboard, you can choose to cancel pending loan requests or repay loans. If a lender agrees to your terms and decides to lend, the loan repay clock will start.

Loans.sol is automated using Chainlink, so if you are unable to repay the loan, it will be automatically defaulted and the collateralized property NFT will move from the escrow to the lender's account. But, if you manage to repay the loan, then no worries, the collateralized NFT will move back from the escrow to your (the borrower's) account.

### 2. You want to lend

Checkout the new arrivals and other loan requests, take a look at the collateral, agree to the borrower's loan terms and lend the requested amount. The borrower owes you the loan amount plus the interest incurred. However, if the borrower fails to repay the loan within the specified time limit, the collateral will move from the escrow to your account, automatically.
